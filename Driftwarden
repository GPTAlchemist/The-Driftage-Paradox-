## 🛠️ Deployment & Usage

Driftwarden is designed to be used **before your custom GPT fails** — not after.

### Input:
- Your full instruction set (.txt, .md)
- Supporting logic files (.yaml, .json)
- Optional output schema / fallback map

### Output:
- Token profile of your GPT scaffold
- Simulated drift window
- Reset thresholds
- YAML drift report ready for injection or monitoring

You can use it to:
- ✅ Validate new GPTs before rollout  
- ✅ Set safe interaction limits for users  
- ✅ Detect early failure points in long-running sessions  
- ✅ Extend the usable life of complex logic chains

## 🔥 Who This Is For

- Prompt engineers running structured GPT systems  
- AI teams deploying GPTs in production environments  
- QA leads tired of inconsistent role or output behavior  
- Builders who want **precision, not vibes**

If your GPT has to perform **consistently** across 10+ turns?  
**Driftwarden belongs in your stack.**

## 🧠 Final Note

GPTs don’t fall apart — they **fade**.

Their roles weaken. Their tone slips.  
Their logic frays at the edge of saturation.

> You don’t need to guess when it happens.  
> You need Driftwarden.
