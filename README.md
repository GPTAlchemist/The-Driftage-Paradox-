## 🔍 Overview

Custom GPTs don’t "forget" your instructions — they **run out of room to remember them**.

This paper explores **instruction drift**: a form of behavioral slippage caused by repeated reprocessing of system prompts, logic files, formatting rules, and embedded examples over long, multi-turn sessions.

If your GPT suddenly starts:

* Ignoring formatting
* Breaking role alignment
* Skipping clarification logic

It’s not hallucination.
It’s **context starvation.**

## 🧡 Why It's Called a Paradox

The **Driftage Paradox** is a systems-level phenomenon in GPT deployments where **contextual integrity decays progressively and unpredictably**, even while staying within the model’s official context window.

The paradox lies in the fact that:

* The system appears functional
* No warnings are issued
* Yet behavior reliability deteriorates
* There is no precise failure point — only **increasing probability of drift**

This isn’t a bug.
It’s the **chaotic edge of deterministic probability**.

> It’s like trying to predict when a counter between 1 and 6 trillion will land on your number. You know it will — but never exactly when.

## 🔧 Safety Margins, Not Certainties

The ≈60,000 token / ≈20 turn thresholds observed in Driftwarden are **not hard failpoints**.
They are **safe operating boundaries** — thresholds meant to give GPT deployments a buffer before instability becomes visible or irreversible.

This is not a precision metric.
It’s a **deployment philosophy**:

> “I can’t predict the exact collapse point, but I can define a safe operating threshold, based on observed entropy across high-logic, role-anchored systems.”

Like a structural engineer:

> “We don’t know when this beam will fail — but with this load and this span, we recommend replacing it every 20 years.”

That’s what **Driftwarden** does:
It’s not just counting tokens — it’s modeling decay risk in a probabilistic environment where GPTs degrade silently and structurally.

## ❗️ The Problem

GPTs do not treat your instructions as a one-time load.
Every turn, they re-ingest:

* 🛠 System prompt
* 📜 Instruction logic
* 🎭 Role + formatting specs
* 🗣️ Embedded examples

So each interaction consumes tokens not just for what's new — but for everything you assumed was already "loaded."

---

## 🔄 The Token Rehydration Cycle

Each user turn includes:

* Reloading the full system prompt
* Reprocessing instruction logic
* Fallback logic (if triggered)
* The user message
* GPT’s full-length response
* Optional tool calls and schema expansion

Even with GPT-4o’s 128K token context window, you’re in trouble long before the ceiling.

## 📊 Example Loadout (GPT-4o, 128K Context Model)

Even though GPT-4o supports a 128K token context window, drift doesn't wait for the hard limit.

Typical breakdown:

* **Instruction payload:** \~9,000 tokens
* **Avg. user interaction (input + output):** \~1,000 tokens
* **Model context limit:** 128,000 tokens
* **Safety buffer (tools, schemas, regen variance):** \~5,000 tokens

🔜 **Drift Starter Threshold:** \~60,000 tokens
🔜 **Observed behavior degradation:** \~Turn 20

🚫 Not because you’ve maxed out the model — but because you’ve **saturated the available clarity**.

At this point, GPT begins struggling to decide what matters most.
It doesn’t crash — it starts guessing what to forget.
Your instruction set, once locked and trusted, becomes part of the chopping block.

---

## ⚠️ This Isn’t a Capacity Issue — It’s a Stability Collapse

Most builders assume drift happens when the token count hits the cap.

**Wrong.** Drift starts when GPT no longer knows what to preserve.

* Competing priorities: schema, examples, fallback logic, long replies
* Instruction set truncation without warning
* Personality slippage and formatting failure
* Behavior becomes vague, generic, or subtly off

This is why Turn 20 is often the beginning of the end — especially in logic-heavy, structured GPTs.
You haven’t hit the wall.

> You’ve entered the fog.

## 📚 Summary: What Drift Really Means

* Drift is **not random**. It's recursive context erosion.
* GPTs reprocess the entire instruction stack every turn.
* Even token-heavy models like GPT-4o degrade at \~60K tokens.
* **The Driftage Paradox** explains why it happens *before* any cap is reached.
* **Driftwarden** is a toolset that models this decay and injects runtime protections.

> Drift isn’t failure. It’s unmeasured erosion.
