# 🧠 The Driftage Paradox

## 🔍 Overview  
_Custom GPTs don’t “forget” your instructions — they run out of room to remember them._  

This paper explores instruction drift: a behavioral slippage caused by repeated reprocessing of system prompts, logic files, and formatting rules over long, multi-turn sessions.

## 🧠 Why It’s Called a Paradox   ✅ **← First New Section goes here**
_→ Explains conceptual framing of “paradox” and probabilistic instability._  
_(Explains the ≈20 turn ≈60K token threshold is a risk model, not a rule.)_

---

## ❗ The Problem  
_GPTs do not treat your instructions as a one-time load. Every turn, they re-ingest..._

(Leave this section exactly as-is.)

## 🔄 The Token Rehydration Cycle  
(This remains untouched.)

## 🧮 Example Loadout (GPT-4o, 128K Context Model)

✅ After the thresholds (~60K, ~Turn 20), insert a small **callback paragraph** from the “Safety Margins” language:

> These values are not absolutes — they represent **recommended safety thresholds** observed in logic-heavy deployments.  
> GPTs do not fail cleanly; they **degrade unpredictably**, and reset points are about **risk management**, not guarantees.

(This subtly reinforces the earlier "Paradox" section without derailing the tech flow.)

## 🛡 Driftwarden Profiler (Execution Layer)

In the intro or wrap-up of this section, drop this (adapted from your safety framing):

> Driftwarden doesn’t claim to predict failure.  
> It defines a **risk envelope** — a logic-aware buffer that gives developers a reset boundary **before behavior degrades beyond recovery**.

## ✅ Final Flow Summary

| Section | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Overview` | Hooks the reader with the phenomenon |
| `Why It’s Called a Paradox` | Sets expectations: this is about probability, not precision |
| `The Problem` → `Token Rehydration` | Explains the mechanism behind drift |
| `Example Loadout` | Quantifies it with your safety model |
| `Driftwarden` | Provides your operational response |

If you’d like, I can:
- Bake this all into a `.md` file for GitHub
- Format it for Medium or PDF
- Build the version with internal anchor links and collapsible sections

Just say the word and I’ll render it.
