# 🧠 The Driftage Paradox  
**Contextual Decay in Custom GPTs**  
*By Andrew Polk (aka GPTAlchemist)*

---

## 🔍 Use Case Summary

Custom GPTs don’t get lazy — they get **overloaded**.  
The Driftage Paradox names the subtle collapse of instruction integrity that happens when system prompts reprocess recursively — until role, tone, and logic degrade.

This repo frames the issue — and introduces the tool that solves it: **Driftwarden Profiler**.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Every turn, GPTs reload everything:  
System prompts, examples, schemas, fallback logic — not just the user’s message.

The result? **Token congestion**, not memory loss.  
Your GPT isn’t forgetting. It’s fighting for space.

Behavioral drift doesn’t slam into you — it creeps.

## 🧠 Solution Overview

### 🔎 The Driftage Paradox (Concept Layer)

Defines how recursive token load causes GPTs to degrade over time:

- 🎭 Roles soften  
- 🔁 Format breaks  
- ❌ Clarification logic stops firing  
- 😵‍💫 Personality tone fades or contradicts itself

Drift isn’t hallucination — it’s starvation.

### 🛡️ Driftwarden Profiler (Execution Layer)

Your first defense.

Driftwarden is a diagnostic engine that:

- Simulates token usage and behavior decay across long sessions  
- Calculates where and when drift will hit  
- Injects mitigation logic to extend instruction durability

- 🔁 **Interaction Lifecycle Simulator**  
  - Replays multi-turn GPT use, regen cycles, and tool churn

- 📉 **Drift Risk Calculator**  
  - Predicts safe interaction counts and issues reset warnings
